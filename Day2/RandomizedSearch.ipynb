    "Ridge regression, on the other hand, adds a regularization term to the loss function, which is the sum of squared coefficients multiplied by a hyperparameter (alpha or lambda). This regularization term penalizes large coefficient values, encouraging the model to keep the coefficients smaller and the model less complex. By doing so, ridge regression reduces the variance in the model and helps prevent overfitting.\n",

    "Linear Regression: Coefficients can take any values to fit the data optimally.\n",
    "Ridge Regression: Coefficients are regularized and tend to be smaller, reducing the impact of individual features and providing a more stable model.\n",
    "In summary, ridge regression is used to improve the performance and generalization of linear regression models, especially when dealing with complex or high-dimensional data that may lead to overfitting. By adding a regularization term, ridge regression trades off some bias for lower variance, leading to a more robust model."
